# gatsbypizza

Working through Wes Bos's Mastering Gatsby tutorial. Commits are done at least once per video and include
details about the motivation and substance of each commit.

A few extra side-projects I'm planning to do with this tutorial:
* (DONE) Use MJML (along with EJS for a template engine) to generate the order email
* Implement the whole thing in NextJS with their SSG engine!
